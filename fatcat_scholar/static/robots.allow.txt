# Hello friends!
# If you are considering large or automated crawling, you may want to look at
# our catalog API (https://api.fatcat.wiki) or bulk database snapshots instead.

# by default, can crawl anything on this domain. HTTP 429 ("backoff") status
# codes are used for rate-limiting instead of any crawl delay specified here.
# Up to a handful concurrent requests should be fine.
User-Agent: *
Allow: /

# crawling search result pages is expensive, so we do specify a long crawl delay for those
User-agent: *
Allow: /search
Crawl-delay: 5
